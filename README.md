# Phenotypic-Selection
This project examines the trends of phenotypic selection in the Florida Scrub-Jay. 
I would suggest reviewing the attached pdf, project summary, first then moving on to lab notebook, and then to the .rmd.
This project was completed under the supervision of Dr. Nancy Chen with Michaela Burell.
